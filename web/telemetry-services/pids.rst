Supported PIDs
--------------

Vinli supports most legislatively required, Mode 1 PIDs within the OBDII protocol. Additionally, we're able to read the VIN. For a complete and up-to-date list of supported PIDs, please visit `<http://dev.vin.li/parameters.json>`_.

If you have a specific question about suppoted PIDs, or are interested in obtaining data points that aren't shown in the parameters.json file, please email us at `dev@vin.li <dev@vin.li>`_.
