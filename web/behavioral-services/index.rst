Behavioral Services
===================

Based on long-term driving data, Vinli calculates and keeps track of behavioral statistics for particular devices and vehicles.

The scores reported by Behavioral Services are meant to convey a driver's overall risk categorization based on historical data gathered by the Vinli device; they are by no means a be-all-end-all measure of the likelihood that a driver will be involved in a collision.  Safe driving involves so many other factors that are not measurable by the Vinli Device; however, Behavioral Services attempts to categorize risk based on what data are available.

The results of these analyses are "Report Cards" for both a single Trip and for a Device's lifetime.  Each report is based on the results of three categories of behavior:

* **Driver Behavior** - the risk based on driving habits detected from the vehicle telemetry including aggressive inputs, erratic driving, speeding, etc.
* **Vehicle Condition** - the risk based on data gathered about vehicle's maintenance condition
* **Travel Patterns** - the risk based on where the driver travels most frequently
