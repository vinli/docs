Report Card Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The Driver Report Card contains the letter grades for trips associated with a device. They are representd as school-like grades such as A or C.

Report Cards for a Device
```````````````````````````````

Returns a Report Card based on historical data for a specified period. In some cases, not enough information was gathered to generate a Report Card.  In these cases, the grades will be reported as "I" (for "Incomplete" to keep the school report card metaphore going).

Report Card for a Trip
``````````````````````

The Trip-specific Report Card contains the same data as the Long-Term and Lifetime Report Card but is specific for a particular Trip.

In some cases, the Trip is too short to generate the data necessary for the Report Card analysis to be run.  In these cases, the grades will be reported as "I".
