Platform Services
===================

Platform Services allow:

* administration of devices
* access to vehicle information, including connected devices
* access to application transaction history

The Vinli device is your app's link to vehicles and drivers. Platform Service helps you keep track of those devices and vehicles.

Apps can access their transaction history. This gives apps a kind of persistent memory of actions taken on the driver's behalf. Apps can use transaction history in many ways:

* see recent transactions
* an administrative log
* to take action on recent administrative events

When device and vehicle data are combined with transaction history, apps can:

* better personalize the app experience
* give hints or tips to users
* help drivers understand app configuration options
