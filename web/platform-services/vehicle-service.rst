Vehicle Service
-----------------

Vinli keeps track of which vehicle a device is or has been plugged into and provides detailed information regarding the specifics about the vehicle.  This gives your application the chance to better personlize the experience of a user as well as the information necessary to classify users and their data by vehicle.  You are only allowed to see vehicles that are associated with a device to which you're application has access.

Vehicle-device assocation is time-based.  A device that is plugged into one vehicle will be associated with that vehicle until it is plugged into a different vehicle.  Vinli keeps track of this history for you.  In the case of a device that is shared between multiple vehicles, the same vehicle will appear multiple times in the history.

Note that when a vehicle is first added to the system (when a Vinli device is plugged into a specific vehicle for the first time), only the VIN number is available.  At some point in time after this, Vinli will update the vehicle information with Year, Make, Model, and Trim in addition to even more detailed information (available through the Vehicle's "self" link).
