Working with DTC Codes
----------------------

Get a list of DTCs for a Vehicle
````````````````````````````````

This provides historical record of DTC codes for a given vehicle.  Each time a new DTC code is seen, it triggers a DTC Event.  These events either resolve when the DTC code is no longer seen or remain "open" until the code is resolved.

      GET https://diagnostic.vin.li/api/v1/vehicles/47fa348e-c3fa-4cad-8272-61940eae7748/codes
      Accept: application/json


The state query param may be used to filter the response. Valid values are active and inactive. These will filter the response to only include either DTC codes that are still on presently or not. The absence of the state query param will not filter the response and so the response will contain the full history DTC codes.

Query by State
++++++++++++++
A request like `GET https://diagnostic.vin.li/api/v1/vehicles/47fa348e-c3fa-4cad-8272-61940eae7748/codes` will return all DTCs for a given vehicle, but sometimes you only want DTCs that are currently active (or inactive).
To do this, simply add the `state` query parameter.

`state` will accept the following options:
 - `active`
 - `inactive`
 - `all` (which is the default)

Here's an example:

::
	
      GET https://diagnostic.vin.li/api/v1/vehicles/47fa348e-c3fa-4cad-8272-61940eae7748/codes?state=active
      Accept: application/json

          }
        }
      }


Battery Status
``````````````
This provides a general health status for a vehicle's battery. Possible statuses include:
 * `green` indicates that the battery is likely to start
 * `yellow` indicates that the battery may have issues starting
 * `red` indicates a battery is likely to not start
 * `null` indicates that Vinli could not determine the status based on the data provided
